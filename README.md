 Overview

This repository provides a collection of Node.js scripts for managing Ethereum smart contracts. It uses the ethers.js library, which is a powerful and easy-to-use library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

The scripts provided here cover various aspects of smart contract management, including compiling Solidity contracts, deploying them to the Ethereum blockchain, interacting with deployed contracts, and encrypting private keys for enhanced security.

 Prerequisites

Before using the scripts in this repository, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- An Ethereum account with a private key
- Access to an Ethereum node (e.g., Infura)
- Solidity compiler (solc)

 Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ethereum-smart-contracts.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```bash
    cd ethereum-smart-contracts
    ```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

 Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can use the provided scripts for compiling, deploying, and interacting with Ethereum smart contracts.

Each script is located in the `scripts` directory and can be executed using Node.js. Make sure to set up your environment variables and configure the scripts accordingly before running them.

 Scripts

 Compile Smart Contract

The `compile.js` script compiles a Solidity smart contract and generates the necessary bytecode and ABI files required for deployment.

```bash
node scripts/compile.js
```

Deploy Smart Contract

The `deploy.js` script deploys a compiled smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain using a specified Ethereum account.

```bash
node scripts/deploy.js
```

 Interact with Smart Contract

The `interact.js` script allows you to interact with a deployed smart contract by calling its functions and reading its state.

```bash
node scripts/interact.js
```

 Encrypt Private Key

The `encryptKey.js` script encrypts a private key using a password and saves the encrypted key to a JSON file.

```bash
node scripts/encryptKey.js
```
